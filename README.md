## FAQ ❓️

#### what's in this? There are so many complaint websites, why choose you?

In any website admin can view who submit the complaint and they could take it personaly.
But in this case admins can only can see student's batch no.

#### what was the need to hide student's details?

when students have issues they are afriad to say because they think it will lead to a mess.
complaints are not usually in pleasent words to admin
